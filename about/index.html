      <p>Hold for Home is an Edmonton-based indie folk band that delivers a musical experience that is close to the heart. With poignant lyrics that challenge the status quo, these individuals create music that rings on as powerful words in your head. Their award-winning single “Gorgeous” best reveals the band’s philosophy to live a life different than the pack. In 2015, the band released their first EP entitled ‘Urban Wildlife’, to honor their first band name and in 2016, they released a music video for their single 'Fireweed'. The powerful melodies and compelling rhythms combine to... really drive it home. With great personality, the band aims to be a social force.</p>
      <p>Currently, Hold for Home is writing new material with the theme of social activism. The plan is to mesh these songs into a full self-produced studio album to be recorded at Copper Cabbage Studios - an Edmonton-based indie studio. This album will feature multiple genres and styles in order to speak the truth of life and deliver it in a compelling way. The group gigs in cafes and bars in and around Edmonton and is planning a tour around Alberta for 2018.</p>
      <p>While the band members each have diverse life stories, Hold for Home is a uniting force that grounds them. Paige Knickle and Ryan Berends, the founding members of the band started writing tunes together in 2011. Paige Knickle, Grand Winning Act of the 2009 Northern Star Talent Search, is a born performer with improv, theatrical, and vocal performance experience under her belt. Ryan Berends is a daring soul who constantly pushes boundaries, taking the band to new domains in genre and style. As an exciting addition to the band in 2015, Nate Arellano provides a vibrant and gratifying flavour to expand the palette and mood with his whimsical playing. Joining the band in 2016, Hazel Cavida adds fundamental instrumentation to give Hold for Home a more dynamic and full sound.</p>
      <p>Hold for Home is a four piece Edmonton indie folk band. They create folk music that speaks to issues to challenge social thought.</p>
